# GIF-decoder
Programming 2 Assignment 1

Write 6 functions that can be used with the import system. We will type import gif at the top of our own script (eg, script.py) and then use your functions to perform tasks. For different arguments passed into the function we will assess the returned values for each function. All code examples described here assume that import gif has been executed prior to each function call. While we are providing example code and a GIF file on blackboard, we will mark your code using a far wider range of test code and test GIF files, which are not being provided to you. It is important that you test your code under a wider range of conditions.
